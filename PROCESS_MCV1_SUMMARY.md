# ProcessMCV1 Component Implementation Summary

## Overview

The ProcessMCV1 component implements realistic MCV1 (Measles-Containing Vaccine, first dose) vaccination with delayed scheduling in the laser-measles ABM framework. This component demonstrates advanced event-driven architecture by listening to birth events and scheduling future vaccinations with configurable delays, simulating real-world healthcare delivery patterns.

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Event-Driven Vaccination Scheduling
- **Birth Event Listening**: Automatically detects newborns through the event system
- **Delayed Vaccination**: Schedules vaccinations after realistic delays (default: 9 months ‚âà 270 days)
- **Stochastic Delays**: Uses gamma or exponential distributions for vaccination timing variability
- **Coverage Control**: Configurable fraction of eligible newborns receive vaccination

### ‚úÖ Realistic Vaccination Parameters
- **Vaccination Efficacy**: Configurable protection rate (default: 90%)
- **Coverage Rates**: Population-level vaccination coverage (default: 100%)
- **Delay Distribution**: Choice between gamma (realistic spread) or exponential distributions
- **Minimum Delays**: Ensures at least 1-day delay for biological realism

### ‚úÖ State Management Integration
- **Agent State Updates**: Moves successfully vaccinated agents from Susceptible (S) to Recovered (R)
- **Patch-Level Tracking**: Updates patch population counts for spatial accuracy
- **Validation Checks**: Ensures agents are alive and susceptible before vaccination
- **Failure Handling**: Gracefully handles agents who die before scheduled vaccination

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Statistics and Events
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks births scheduled, vaccinations completed, protection rates
- **Event Emission**: Emits vaccination events for other components to utilize
- **Detailed Logging**: Optional verbose output for debugging and monitoring
- **Real-time Statistics**: Access to current vaccination status and pending schedules

## Architecture

### Event Flow
1. **Birth Detection**: Component listens to `births` events from VitalDynamicsProcess
2. **Scheduling Phase**: Generates vaccination delays and schedules future vaccinations
3. **Processing Phase**: On scheduled ticks, validates agents and performs vaccinations
4. **State Updates**: Updates agent and patch states, emits vaccination events
5. **Statistics Tracking**: Maintains comprehensive metrics throughout simulation

### Key Classes

#### MCV1Params (Configuration)
```python
class MCV1Params(BaseModel):
    vaccination_delay_mean: float = 270.0     # ~9 months delay
    vaccination_efficacy: float = 0.9         # 90% protection rate
    coverage: float = 1.0                     # 100% coverage
    delay_distribution: str = "gamma"         # Delay distribution type
```

#### ProcessMCV1 (Main Component)
```python
class ProcessMCV1(BasePhase, EventMixin):
    def handle_birth_event(self, event: BaseEvent)    # Schedule vaccinations
    def _generate_delays(self, n_agents: int)         # Generate realistic delays
    def _vaccinate_agents(self, model, agents, tick)  # Perform vaccinations
    def get_stats(self)                               # Access statistics
```

### Integration Pattern
```python
# Component automatically integrates with event system
class ProcessMCV1(BasePhase, EventMixin):
    def __init__(self, model, verbose=False, params=None):
        super().__init__(model, verbose)
        self.params = params or MCV1Params()
        self.__init_event_mixin__()  # Enable event capabilities
        
        # Initialize vaccination schedule
        self.vaccination_schedule = defaultdict(list)
    
    def set_event_bus(self, event_bus):
        """Called automatically by ABMModel during setup"""
        super().set_event_bus(event_bus)
        self.subscribe_to_events(['births'], self.handle_birth_event)
    
    def handle_birth_event(self, event):
        """React to births by scheduling future vaccinations"""
        newborn_indices = event.data.get('agent_indices', [])
        delays = self._generate_delays(len(newborn_indices))
        
        for agent_idx, delay in zip(newborn_indices, delays):
            vaccination_tick = event.tick + int(delay)
            self.vaccination_schedule[vaccination_tick].append(agent_idx)
```

## Realistic Vaccination Modeling

### ‚úÖ Delay Distribution Modeling
The component uses gamma distribution (shape=4.0) to model vaccination delays:
- **Realistic Spread**: Coefficient of variation ~0.5 matches real-world data
- **No Zero Delays**: Minimum 1-day delay ensures biological plausibility
- **Configurable Mean**: Default 270 days (9 months) aligns with WHO recommendations
- **Alternative Distributions**: Exponential distribution available for comparison studies

### ‚úÖ Healthcare System Simulation
- **Coverage Limitations**: Not all eligible children receive vaccination
- **Efficacy Modeling**: Even vaccinated children may not develop immunity
- **Timing Variability**: Reflects real-world healthcare delivery challenges
- **Agent Validation**: Handles deaths and state changes before vaccination

### ‚úÖ Event Data Structure
Vaccination events provide rich information for downstream components:
```python
{
    'event_type': 'vaccination',
    'agent_indices': [100, 101, 102],        # All vaccinated agents
    'protected_agents': [100, 102],          # Successfully protected
    'unprotected_agents': [101],             # Vaccination failed
    'efficacy_achieved': 0.67,               # Actual protection rate
    'vaccination_type': 'mcv1',              # Vaccine type identifier
    'tick': 365                              # When vaccination occurred
}
```

## Test Results and Validation

### ‚úÖ Component Integration
- **Event System Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with existing event infrastructure
- **Model Lifecycle**: Properly initializes and cleans up during simulation
- **Performance**: Minimal computational overhead despite complex scheduling
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing components unaffected by vaccination addition

### ‚úÖ Realistic Behavior
- **Delayed Response**: Vaccinations occur months after births, not immediately
- **Stochastic Outcomes**: Both delay timing and efficacy show realistic variability
- **Population Dynamics**: Affects disease transmission through reduced susceptible population
- **Spatial Accuracy**: Maintains correct patch-level population counts

## Usage Examples

### Basic Configuration
```python
from project.abm.components import ProcessMCV1, MCV1Params

# Standard 9-month delayed vaccination with 85% coverage
params = MCV1Params(
    vaccination_delay_mean=270.0,  # 9 months
    vaccination_efficacy=0.9,      # 90% effective
    coverage=0.85                  # 85% coverage
)

model.components = [
    ProcessVitalDynamics,  # Provides birth events
    ProcessMCV1,          # Listens and schedules vaccinations
    # ... other components
]
```

### Custom Delay Distribution
```python
# Use exponential delays for sensitivity analysis
params = MCV1Params(
    vaccination_delay_mean=180.0,      # 6 months average
    delay_distribution="exponential",   # More variable timing
    coverage=0.95                      # High coverage scenario
)
```

### Accessing Statistics
```python
# Get comprehensive vaccination metrics
mcv1_component = model.get_instance(ProcessMCV1)[0]
stats = mcv1_component.get_stats()

print(f"Births scheduled: {stats['births_scheduled']}")
print(f"Vaccinations completed: {stats['vaccinations_completed']}")
print(f"Overall protection rate: {stats['overall_protection_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Pending vaccinations: {stats['pending_vaccinations']}")
```

### Event-Based Monitoring
```python
# Create component that reacts to vaccination events
class VaccinationTracker(BaseComponent, EventMixin):
    def set_event_bus(self, event_bus):
        self._event_bus = event_bus
        self.subscribe_to_events(['vaccination'], self.track_vaccination)
    
    def track_vaccination(self, event):
        efficacy = event.data['efficacy_achieved']
        # Track vaccination effectiveness over time
```
